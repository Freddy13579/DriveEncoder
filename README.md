# DriveEncoder
### Version 0.1

This is a program which can encode or decode text files in a folder with a passworld.

### !!WARNING!! Use only with .txt files
### !!WARNING!! Execute the file directry or use a win lnk file becouse it will start to encrypt files where it was executed, not where it was located. If your not sure you can check the first line after executing where you can see the Directory.

If your program crashes mid encrypting you can use my other tool, where you can recover file by decoding them one by one with this: https://github.com/Freddy13579/TextEncoder
