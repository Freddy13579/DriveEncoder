# DriveEncoder
### Version 0.1

This is a program which can encode or decode text files in a folder with a passworld and it will generate files named .ENCRYPTED or .DECRYPTED to show you the folders status.

### !!WARNING!! Use only with .txt files and dont have any sub folders - it will crash
### !!WARNING!! Execute the file directry or use a win lnk file becouse it will start to encrypt files where it was executed, not where it was located. If your not sure you can check the first line after executing where you can see the Directory.

The program will ignor files named: 
1. .DriveEncoder.py
2. .ENCRYPTED
3. .DECRYPTED
4. .DriveEncoder.exe

If your program crashes mid encrypting you can use my other tool, where you can recover file by decoding them one by one with this: https://github.com/Freddy13579/TextEncoder
